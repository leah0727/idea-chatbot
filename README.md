# AI Idea Contest: Chatbot-Based Mental Health Monitoring System for the Elderly

## Overview
- Proposed an AI-driven chatbot system designed to monitor and support the mental health of elderly individuals living alone, specifically addressing dementia and depression.
- Motivated by factors such as the aging population, mental health challenges among the elderly, limitations of the current healthcare system, the economic efficiency of digital healthcare advancements, and the increasing use of electronic devices among seniors.
- Suggested a solution where the AI chatbot listens to daily conversations in place of caregivers, collects patient history, and provides a diagnosis of potential dementia. Outlined AI-based approaches for data collection, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
- Suggested toc collect and analyze voice data to assess tone, and monitor emotional states through regular interactions with the chatbot, aiming to enable early diagnosis and prevention of depression.
- Proposed an AI solution utilizing CNN for feature extraction from voice signals related to elderly depression, LSTM for processing temporal data and tracking emotional changes, and MLP for final classification and diagnosis of depression.
- **The code in this repository is for this.** Highlighted the expected impact of the mental health monitoring system for the elderly living alone, predicting a more than twofold increase in mental health support for those with limited access to healthcare in rural areas compared to urban regions, based on EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the healthcare disparity between urban and rural populations. 
- Skills: Python, pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
